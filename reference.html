<p> The idea for this page was inspired from the news about the US open championships, The link to the website is right <a href="http://www.usopen.org/index.html?promo=topnav"><em>here</em></a>. I believe the main reason the page stands out is because of the colorful nature and proper arrangement of the contents, The content provided is apt and promotes the game which is the direct intention of the site. The links to navigate within the website are beautifully hidden in the "Menu" such that it provides more space for the actual content. It is evident from the first look at the site that there are lot more of photos than text or any other content, this is the most brilliant way to make people look at the entire site cause who doesn't like to look at pictures, also you can notice that like all websites, it employs the colors that our brain picks up immediately, blue, red and yellow. I believe the styling and the arrangement makes it look extraordinary.</p>
